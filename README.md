# Album-Sales-Projections
## Purpose
The goal of this project was to employ statistical modeling to accurately forecast the album sales for Radiohead's iconic sophomore album, _The Bends_. In probability modeling, a trade-off often exists between heterogeneity, duration dependence, and external effects that the model must account for, which I tried to resolve here! See my other project, "Olympic Model Wins Estimation" and check out Professor Peter Fader's work for more information on probability modeling!
## Languages
- Excel (see the other project for more information on why we use Excel!)
## Set-Up Guide
All of the data is included directly in the Excel file!
